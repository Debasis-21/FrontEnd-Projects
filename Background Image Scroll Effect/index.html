        <h1>Welcome to Rajasthan</h1>
        <p>
            Rajasthan literally means <b>"The Land of Kings"</b>. The State of Rajasthan was formed on <b>30 March
                1949</b> when the
            states of the Rajputana Agency of the restwhile Indian Empire were merged into the new Indian Union. Its
            capital and largest city is Jaipur.

        <p>
            Jaipur is known as the <b>Pink City</b>, due to dominant colour scheme of its buildings. On 6 July 2019,
            UNESCO
            World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its World Heritage Sites. The city
            is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar.
